## Why this matters

If world-class theorists, founders, and educators are making AI part of their daily toolkit, we should pay attention. This week's roundup highlights respected leaders who have already crossed that bridge.

    <h3>Scott Aaronson lets GPT-5 co-author a quantum proof</h3>
    <p><strong class="highlight highlight--indigo">Quantum complexity veteran Scott Aaronson</strong>, the Schlumberger Centennial Chair of Computer Science at UT Austin and director of its Quantum Information Center, studies the theoretical limits of quantum computation. He spent 2022-24 on leave at OpenAI working on the foundations of AI safety.</p>
    <p>In his latest collaboration with Freek Witteveen, "The QMA Singularity," Aaronson treated <span class="highlight highlight--blue">GPT5-Thinking</span> like a sharp grad student. After a few rounds of correction, the model proposed the rational-function trick that unlocked their proof about the limits of QMA amplification. Curious how a careful skeptic pilots AI?

    <h3>Brian Armstrong wants half of Coinbase's code AI-generated</h3>
    <p><strong class="highlight highlight--orange">Coinbase co-founder and CEO Brian Armstrong</strong> oversees one of the most heavily regulated engineering stacks in fintech. In a recent note to teams, he revealed that roughly 40% of the daily code merged at Coinbase is now AI-authored.</p>
    <p>The target is clear: push that share past 50% by October while insisting on careful human review. It's a pragmatic blueprint for adopting AI assistants without compromising compliance.

    <h3>Ethan Mollick documents the new division of labor</h3>
    <p><strong class="highlight highlight--teal">Wharton professor Ethan Mollick</strong> has become the go-to guide for applied AI in classrooms and boardrooms. In his latest field note, he describes a mathematician partnering with GPT-5 Pro to produce genuinely novel proofs.</p>
    <p>The take-home message: experts steer, models accelerate, and together they cover more ground than either alone. Mollick's thread is a quick calibration for anyone designing human-in-the-loop workflows: <a href="https://x.com/emollick/status/1964447221853966775?s=58&t=PNRV2BDG854eWRibC86Qfw">Mollick on guiding GPT-5 Pro</a>.</p>

## Takeaway

The takeaway is simple: serious researchers and operators aren't waiting for perfect tools--they're already pairing judgment with AI to move faster. Expect our own experiments to lean harder into that loop.
